 Please note, I chose ARIMA forecasting model for this project , the convention of train, splits is not the same nor the forecasting. But I will take you through it.
 
 
 1. Please review  CS_PKJM.READMEFIRST RISE generated pdf 
 2. Should you have more time, you can spin up the python notebook and give a go on the scripts
 3. Runtime folder has  the docker version of it, you just need to Dockerfile , and access the app on http://0.0.0.0:8082
 
 This is my first forecasting project , I enjoyed  it, then I read alot of literature, accessed alot medium articles in addition to course content provided
 
 Hope you Enjoy!
